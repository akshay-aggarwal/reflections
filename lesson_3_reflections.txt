When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans. When I have multiple workstations, and I want a central repository to keep them in sync, or when there are multiple collaborators for the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans. Updates in the remote might conflict with the exising code in the local repository, or the user might be testing some feature, and a pull might break the code.
